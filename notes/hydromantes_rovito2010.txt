ROVITO, S.M. (2010), Lineage divergence and speciation in the Web-toed Salamanders (Plethodontidae: Hydromantes) of the Sierra Nevada, California. Molecular Ecology, 19: 4554-4571. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04825.x

This is the only Hydromantes reference I've found that mentions lakes (see Appendix listing collection localities). I emailed the author (who I know from his time spent at UC Berkeley) and asked him about those lake-associated collections. I specifically asked him whether he collected salamanders at or in the listed lakes or in seep habitats about the lakes. His response: "As far as I remember, I never found any salamander in or on the edge of a lake itself but rather in seep habitat on the rocky slopes above." So, that means our observations are novel.
