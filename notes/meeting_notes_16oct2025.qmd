**Meeting Notes - 16 October 2025 - Roland, Parker, Georgia**

What observations we have:

-   South Lyell nighttime 2024, 2025 (PL, GL, LW) :

<!-- -->

-   Goddard day/night 2025 (PL, GL) :

-   Laurel nighttime 2024, 2025 (RK, FP, CS) : furthest south locality of H.
    platycephalus, no salamanders during daytime surveys, 2024: \~15 individuals seen during nighttime surveys in \~20m shore along northern shoreline; 2025: 20-30 individuals along the southern shoreline during nighttime surveys and some in the water

What’s the story that we want to tell?

A novel natural history observation : large numbers congregating on alpine lakeshores (esp. at Laurel, S Lyell) using lake habitat

Described habitat of H.
platycephalus is wet granite seeps, under rocks.
Our observations indicated H.
platycephalus along lake shores and in lakes.

-   Background research/literature search on H.
    platycephalus… are our observation truly novel?

Considerations regarding disclosing location information: see “[Do Not Publish](https://library.iucn-isg.org/documents/2017/Lindenmayer_2017_Science.pdf)” paper… How specific will we be with our locality information?
Will this publication have any negative impacts on the species?
(common species versus rare and sensitive species) ie.
“Laurel Basin” vs “headwaters of Laurel Creek”...
do we include coordinates of these unnamed lakes?

Figures/visualizations?

When choosing a journal to submit note to, think about "open access".
Are the contents of a journal freely available to anyone or are the contents behind a pay wall?
Open access journals may charge an additional fee compared to pay walled journals.

Possible journals:

-   natural history note in Herpetological Review (not open access): Guidelines available [here](https://ssarherps.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/NatHistNotes_FormattingGuidelines-Feb2020-1.pdf). Content from last five years available to SSAR members only. Previous content is open access.
-   nature note in Ecology & Evolution (open access w/ author publication fee): Guidelines available [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.6534) and [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/20457758/homepage/forauthors.html).

Because of the brevity of our observations, they are probably best suited as a Natural History Note in Herpetological Review.

Writing logistics:

There is interest in using this natural history note as an opportunity to learn how to write a manuscript using a reproducible workflow.
RStudio/Quarto and Git/GitHub.

R Studio: writing a manuscript directly in R Studio (open access, transparent process, not-for-profit, citation ease with code)

Github for version control: keeping track of every version over time, allows remote collaboration, reproducible

Resources for learning R/Github: [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/), [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

Issues remaining to discuss and resolve: Authorship, timeframes, and responsibilities
